**Breaking Change**

Replaced Python's `list` with `collections.abc.MutableSet` for the property `Dag.tags`.

At the constractur you still can use list,
you actually can use any data structure that implements the
`collections.abc.Collection` interface.

The `tags` property of the `Dag` model would be of type
`collections.abc.MutableSet` instead of `list`,
as there are no actual duplicates at the tags.
